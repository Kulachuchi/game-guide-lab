Idea for the Social Media project is to make it a Game Forum-like-app with almost the same features but different color aesthetic.
The codes and the design will based on my previous project from Tomorrow's Web that involves using different APIs but adding in or using 
other functions.

Some features that may be added:
1. The tabs will be on the header or on the top that navigates through different web page of the app.
2. On the home page there will be two/three div sections. The middle section will have the posts appearing on it which inlcudes your posts
and the others' posts to view.
3. Other features like finding a specific post that includes file attachments or by inputting a keyword could be added to the app to help
find posts easier
4. Profile page which has your username, profile pictures and banners/cover photo, some little information about you, customized statuses,
and shows the posts that you have posted on the platform.

Some problems that needs to be addressed:
1. MongoDB not linking properly or unable to link
